    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of self-rising flour or pastry flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 splash of olive oil</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup of milk (180 milliliters)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Utensils</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Pancake molds</li>
        <li>Silicone spatula</li>
        <li>Pan (optional)</li>
        <li>Bowl</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>First, gather all the ingredients. If you donâ€™t have self-rising or prepared flour, which is wheat flour that already includes yeast (also called pastry flour), you can use regular wheat flour and add a teaspoon of baking powder.</li>

        <li>Place the flour in a bowl and add the egg and milk. Mix well until these ingredients are integrated and there are almost no lumps.</li>

        <li>To finish making the dough for the homemade pancakes, add a splash of oil and mix well. You will see that the oil causes the flour lumps to dissolve and leaves a smooth and homogeneous dough.</li>

        <li>To make the pancakes, heat a pan over medium-low heat with a little oil or butter. When the pan is hot, add a spoonful of mixture and leave it on the fire until bubbles start to appear on the surface, then flip it and cook on the other side.</li>

        <li>To serve the super easy to make pancake recipe, add a little butter and honey and enjoy. If you want to eat them with something salty, you can serve them with bacon and fried eggs or a scrambled ham.</li>
    </ol>
